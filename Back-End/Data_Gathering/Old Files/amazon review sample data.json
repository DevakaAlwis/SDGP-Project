They seriously must have driven it right to my house it was that fast. Amazing price, amazing quality. Everything was in original packaging with plastic and instruction manual. Lights work and it sounds AMAZING. Very quiet, and comfortable keyboard. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Thank you!",

      "review": "Just got the keyboard. It looks good and functions fine, but when I went to download the Razer Synapse software to change the RGB lights, I read in their license agreement that Razer sells your personal information and data to third parties. And in case of a data breach at Razer, personal info and data could be accessed by bad actors. So I wonï¿½t be downloading it. Luckily there is open source software to change the RGB lighting.",

      "review": "It has a bit lower profile compared to V2. Keys sound is louder a bit. Support bar is plastic and not comfortable. Space bar sounds a bit different. Looks cheaper in general.---Changed rating from 3 stars to 4.5-5 after almost 1 month use. It's VERY comfortable to type on. The only cons: spacebar sound differs from other keys and design of volume control looks a bit \"cheap\". But I got used to it and now it's my main driver. Do recommend 100%.",
