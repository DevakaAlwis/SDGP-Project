      "body": "This is coming from a hard-core Xbox user. I ended up getting this console through a coworker of mine who was selling it because it wasn’t the version he wanted I had previously gotten a PS4 just for God of war and then got sucked into a few of the other PlayStation exclusive games. My biggest issue with PlayStation has always been their controller it doesn’t feel ergonomically correct like the Xbox one I have big hands and I always felt like my hands were scrunched up and the other PlayStation controllers. Once I got my hands on the PlayStation five I immediately noticed the difference in size not only the console itself which is huge by the way you’re basically buying a PC hard drive, The controller was the biggest difference for me. Well it still has all the same buttons and features as the previous PS4 controller this thing is bigger and actually looks like they put some thought into the controller. It looks like it was made with some decent quality and I am quite impressed with",

      "body": "Next-gen? Really? It looks identical to ps4 pro as far as graphics and fps go. The home interface was terribly thought out. And why can't I use in game screen shots as backgrounds anymore? The ps4 and ps3 could, but not the next gen ps5? The ps3 could play audio cd's and upload them to the ps3 system and played during any game...why can't a next gen ps5 do that? Over half the ps5's game library are \"constant internet required\" games. Single player games require internet? And...lol, the ps5 weights 14lbs and almost twice the size of the original style ps3. I guess I just miss the days where everyone could play any game without being punished cause they don't want to play online. And tired of buying the next gen console that does less then the one before it. Side note: the ps5 controller is complete crap. Laggy response and the new trigger effects constantly go berserk after a few hrs of use and have to be manually shut off.",

The graphics are amazing. Loading times are incredible fast. The system itself is huge, but you can place it standing up or on the side. The ergonomics of the controller is fantastic; it feels amazing on your hands. Plus, the controller has this sweet feature where it vibrant depending on where your character steps. You can feel the difference when your character walks on sand vs. a hard surface; hopefully upcoming games take advantage of this feature. Overall, it's a great system and I will have lots of use and enjoyment out of this.",

Definitely more customizable and user friendly. The controller is a huge improvement. I’m definitely impressed with it. Graphics are amazing and so much more detailed. However, if you don’t have a tv that’s 4K with HDR and runs at least 60Hz then you won’t see a difference between the 5 over the 4. Make sure your tv is up to date to receive the full effect this system has to offer. Highly recommended!",

I have to say I like the UI better on the PlayStation 4 as the PS5's is sometimes difficult to navigate. There are a lot of awesome features though, like picking right back up where you left off after the system enters rest mode. My only real complaint is the huge lack of system storage and capabilities to upgrade the storage. I can fit maybe 7 games at a time on the console at most. System needs upgraded SSD capability. On the PS4 I never had an issue with storage management thanks to my 6 TB hardrive upgrade. 4/5, would be 5/5 with upgraded storage capability.",
